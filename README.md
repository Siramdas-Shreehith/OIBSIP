# OIBSIP
The Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship offers hands-on experience in data analysis and machine learning. Interns work on real-world projects like iris classification, car price prediction, and spam detection using Python, pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to build practical data-driven skills.

**Data Science Projects**

Welcome to my collection of practical Data Science mini projects — each designed to explore datasets, visualize insights, and build predictive models. Perfect for beginners and enthusiasts looking to apply data science concepts in real-world scenarios.

These projects were inspired and developed during my participation in the AICTE-approved Oasis Infobyte Internship, where I gained hands-on experience in Data Science, Python, and Machine Learning.

🚀 Projects Overview
1️⃣ Iris Flower Classification

Predicts the type of iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) using petal and sepal measurements. A classic classification project for beginners.

2️⃣ Unemployment Analysis

Analyzes unemployment trends and visualizes changes over time. Learn to extract insights from socio-economic data.

3️⃣ Car Price Prediction

Predicts car prices based on features like mileage, horsepower, and brand. A regression project to explore real-world pricing predictions.

4️⃣ Email Spam Detection

Classifies emails as spam or ham using text processing and machine learning. A practical introduction to NLP and classification.

5️⃣ Sales Prediction

Predicts product sales based on advertising data (TV, radio, and newspaper). Understand the relationship between marketing and sales using regression modeling.
